# Prototype Instructions

Run the local server yourself and open the preview in the browser available to this environment. Do not give the user server-start instructions when you can run it.

Before making substantial visual changes, use the Product Design plugin's `get-context` skill when the visual source is unclear or no longer matches the current goal. When the user gives durable prototype-specific design feedback, preferences, or decisions, record them in `AGENTS.md`.

When implementing from a selected generated mock, treat that image as the source of truth for layout, component anatomy, density, spacing, color, typography, visible content, and hierarchy.

Build app UI in `src/`. Keep `.openai/hosting.json`, `worker/index.js`, `scripts/prepare-sites-build.mjs`, and `tests/sites-worker.test.mjs` intact so the same local prototype can be handed to Sites. Before a Sites handoff, run `npm run build` and `npm run test:sites`; the build must leave `dist/client/index.html`, `dist/server/index.js`, and `dist/.openai/hosting.json`.

Typography preference: prioritize comfortable readability over ultra-compact UI. Keep non-heading text at 12px or larger; use roughly 13–15px for supporting copy and controls where layout permits.

Vehicle gallery preference: clicking the main image should open an immersive modal with a vertical photo stream similar to Auto.ru. On desktop, keep a sticky left-side thumbnail rail for quick navigation and expose the full thumbnail set; on mobile, support horizontal swipe navigation directly on the main gallery.

Visual QA preference: do not run browser-based visual checks, take implementation screenshots, or perform design-QA comparisons unless the user explicitly asks. The user reviews visual changes manually. Validate changes with build, tests, and non-visual checks only.

Home vehicle feed preference: show an endless randomized feed, 4 cards per row on desktop, with automatic loading on scroll. Do not show the “Карточка доступна” status label anywhere in the product.

Search filter preference: use the home-page filter as the shared pattern across home and catalog. Keep the “Все / Электромобили / Гибриды” tabs plus brand, model, year, price, and mileage in the primary area. Place body type and optional advanced fields in the collapsible section below. In the lower action row, align the “Ещё фильтры” control left and the primary CTA right; use the orange accent color.

Expanded search grid preference: on desktop, keep the expanded filter fields in the same five-column grid as the primary filters, leaving unused grid cells empty rather than redistributing fields into fewer, wider columns.

Default search filter preference: initial year, price, and mileage values must be explicitly unbounded (“Любой …”), so the initial result count equals the full catalog total. Apply limits only after the user selects one.

Advanced catalog filter preference: show drive, owners, and insurance-history filters only when those fields are present in the returned dataset. Do not offer a range filter while range coverage is incomplete. Disable model selection until a brand is selected.

Expanded filter layout preference: keep the primary “Показать … авто” action in the lower action row both when “Ещё фильтры” is collapsed and expanded.

Vehicle card preview preference: on pointer-hover desktop layouts, split the image into 4–5 horizontal cursor zones that switch among the first listing photos, with a compact segmented position indicator similar to Auto.ru. Keep touch previews stable.

Featured card pricing preference: do not show the “под ключ до Минска” label on home-page vehicle cards. Keep the price left-aligned with the title and metadata, and use compact vertical spacing between card text rows.

Featured card content preference: do not show the source price in Chinese yuan on home-page vehicle cards.

Listing age preference: show how long a listing has been on Guazi only when Guazi supplies an actual publication/listing timestamp. Never substitute the local import, price-history, sitemap last-modified, or monitoring first-seen timestamp.

Freshness-label preference: do not show internal refresh, import, check, or update timestamps in the customer-facing UI, including labels such as “Актуализировано”, “обновлено”, and “Источник проверен”.

Vehicle detail facts preference: place characteristics in a single vertical icon-led list directly below the gallery, followed by “Что указано в объявлении” in the same row-based layout.

Vehicle fact typography preference: use larger, comfortably readable text for characteristic labels and values—16px on desktop and 15px on mobile.

Localization preference: show Chinese listing cities in Russian. Present source letter grades as plain-language vehicle-condition labels; do not expose the source name in catalog result metadata.

Catalog navigation preference: when returning from a vehicle page, preserve the catalog filters, sorting, number of loaded results, and scroll position. The in-app “back to catalog” action should use the same history entry when the vehicle was opened from the catalog.

Vehicle estimate card preference: keep the “Итого” block light with dark text rather than using a dark inversion that competes with the orange CTA. Show the approximate delivery time to Minsk in a separate explanatory card below the estimate; use 35–50 days from signing the contract unless the business estimate changes.

Estimate-description preference: keep explanatory copy for individual cost rows behind an info icon beside the row title. Show it only while the icon is hovered and hide it immediately when the pointer leaves; do not toggle it by click.
